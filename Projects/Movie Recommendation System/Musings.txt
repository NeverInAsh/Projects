Movie Recommender System:-
Objective:- To understand and learn basics of recommender systems. Pearson correlation score was used as it tends to give better results in situation where data 
isn’t well normalized.
Note that data format is quite important
Code flows as follows :-
1) simDistance(x,p1,p2) :- This function is used to find person correlation score between the movie choices of two persons.
2) topMatches(x,person,top,similarity=simDistance)/ topMatches2(x,person,similarity=simDistance) :-
This function is used to give top or total matches ordered by similarity score. This function can be exploited to draw graph network of the concerned person. 
So based on mod(diff b/w pearson score) a basic graph can be drawn. A weighted graph with weights being the pearson score can also be done.
3) recoItem(x,item=movies,similarity=topMatches2,person) :- This function is a basic recommendation algorithm.
4) changeform(x) :- Primarily reco systems are user or customer centric i.e. recommending item based on similarity score amongst the crowd. 
But recommendation is product centric then it can help the service provider to select and buy only the movies which are more likely to be watched 
movies[Segmentation based on demographics can be done to further better the model..]. This will improve the bottomline(profits).
