*************Neural Network as a Image Enhancement Technique**************
Image can either be smoothed or synthesized, so that is where neural nets come in they are
used in designing of filters which reduce noise and helps in edge detection. These filters
are can be effectively used to remove the mixed Gaussian and impulsive noises and sharpen
the edges.

Tentative Date:- by June 2016

*************Image Based Search Engine***************

This project is in ideation stage.
Objective:- To build a basic Content based search engine.Due to vast variety of content 
available it sometimes becomes difficult to search through endless pages just to get that
one particular type of content. This can be music, software files or even images.

I plan to implement this content based search engine on 'Images'

Features will be as follows:- 
1) Category/Context of Image:- Like a person, place, object, food etc.
2) Color Scheme:- Color makes the image take values in a color vector space. There can not
be any universal color system as each color system has its own parameters.Some can be
Intensity, Hue, Saturation, RGB( This will be very useful in classifying the images.)	
3) Shape:- detect and classify the physical nature of edges in images using reflectance 
information, to compute edges automatic gradient thresholding can be used.
**Grouping Data**
When searching for an object, it would be most advantageous to do a complete
object segmentation first.
